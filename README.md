# SIADS 521 - Visual Exploration of Data
This notebook presents data from a project conducted at the German Sport University in Cologne in collaboration with adidas, where ten football types were kicked by a robotic cylinder leg to analyze flight trajectories without spin. Using the TrackMan radar system, 480 kicks were recorded, providing insights into launch velocity, flight time, and launch angles for each football.
